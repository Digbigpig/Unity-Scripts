This is a preview of a Unity project I built independently.

About:
  I began this project using the RPG tutorial series by Brackeys on youtube. I have expanded it to include a WASD movement system that manipulates the Unity AI Agent model. The biggest contribution I have made is the skill based combat system and related combat UI and targeting.
  
Purpose: 
  This repo is to visually demonstrate the features I have created for this project. Some scripts may be presented here in the future once they have been commented and cleaned up or by request. To see an accurate depiction of my code please visit the Storktation/Scripts dir of this repo.
