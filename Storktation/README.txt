This directory is a collection of scripts and image/videos from a project that I am passively developing with one other contributor.

The Game:
  There is a short video demonstrating the gameplay. The core mechanic of the game is to correctly sort a certain number of boxes to the correct lane. For example, you'll see that each box has a label which contains a letter and a city name. The letter corresponds to which lane that box must be sorted to. Once you drop that box on the correct lane the conveyor moves the package in to the correct gaylord where it is either correctly or incorrectly sorted.

About:
  In its current state, the project is in the process of updating, creating, and importing new models to replace the current unskinned and default "box" objects. On the current build, the new models were imported with a different scale which caused a lot of graphical issues such as the "labels" looking obnoxiously big and unprofessional. This will be corrected in future builds once all models have been finalized. 
  
Purpose:
  The purpose of this repo is to show my strengths as an independent, self-taught developer and I would encourage you to look at the scripts folder which contains the files I have wrote for this project in particular.
